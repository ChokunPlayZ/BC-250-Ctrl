# Local HTTP API

The API is available in Wi-Fi and hybrid operation. It is also available on the temporary configuration AP. Normal station-mode requests use HTTP Basic authentication with username `admin`; the AP relies on its WPA2 provisioning password.

All configuration responses redact the Wi-Fi password and password hash. Sending an empty `wifi_password` preserves the current credential.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/status`

Returns firmware version, authoritative power state, sensed state, output activity, Wi-Fi status, Zigbee status, OTA capability, and currently present BLE matcher labels.

### `POST /api/v1/power`

```json
{"action":"on"}
```

Supported actions are `on`, `off`, `toggle`, and `force_off`. The response acknowledges that the action was queued; the state machine may subsequently reject a conflicting action or one sent during fault cooldown. Read `/api/v1/status` to observe the result. `409 Conflict` means the action was invalid or the queue was full.

### `GET /api/v1/config`

Returns the complete non-secret configuration used by the setup UI.

### `PUT /api/v1/config`

Applies a partial JSON patch, validates pin conflicts and timing constraints, stores it in the pending configuration slot, then reboots. The previous active configuration remains available until the new firmware has run healthily for 30 seconds.

### `POST /api/v1/ble/scan`

Starts a 15-second active discovery scan.

### `GET /api/v1/ble/scan`

Returns recent discovery results with address, address type, name, and RSSI.

### `GET /api/v1/events`

Streams server-sent `status` events when the state or optocoupled sense changes, with keepalives and automatic reconnect after a bounded one-minute session.

### `POST /api/v1/zigbee`

Send `{"action":"commission"}` to start network steering or `{"action":"reset"}` to erase only Zigbee network state.

### `POST /api/v1/factory-reset`

Only available from the configuration AP. Send `{"confirm":"ERASE ALL"}` to erase all NVS configuration and Zigbee network data, then reboot into first-boot provisioning.

### `POST /api/v1/update`

Available only in 8 MB builds. Send the application binary as the request body. ESP-IDF writes the inactive OTA partition and validates the image before switching boot slots. A newly booted image marks itself valid after 30 seconds.

The endpoint does not accept a complete factory image containing bootloader and partitions.
